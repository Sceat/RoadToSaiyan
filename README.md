These programs should be used as a guideline, everyone is different and you need to adapt these programs to yourself !  
> For the bodyweight part you can choose exercises from the bundle and make your own schedule or simply follow the Workout schedule (which is made to progress in workout more than earn muscle) and adapt rep, exercices and rest ! 
 
> For the musculation program you can follow the schedule but you need to vary exercises on the time 
 
## Musculation part 
The schedule exemple is a 5 days split which means you train 5 days a week with different muscular group each day. 
Feel free to change the synergy by replacing the monday with legs + abs instead of pecs for exemple or other programs 

## Workout part
The schedule is a 5 days split too ! Theses programs are intended to gain strengh more than muscle masse. This is a way to learn street workout more than a bodyweight musculation method. You can obviously adapt all programs with custom exercises and increase difficulty by doing more reps with less rest time. Enjoy #roadtosaiyan
